Project Description

Goal:
Provide a useful app for the Charlotte Visitor's Center.  This application will show the sites and points of interest in Downtown Charlotte, with images, descriptions, maps, and augmented camera images.

Implementation Expectation:
Expect to create a screen with multiple page tabs.  Each tab will be:
1) Listing of Points of Interest
2) Overall map of Area
3) Your planned itinerary

The Listing of the points of interest will show a name & image of each point of interest in the current visitor center's brochure.  Clicking on one of the items in the list will send you to a navigational page which shows a larger picture on top and full description on bottom.  You can add/remove these items to your itinerary listing from the detail page, as well as view where it is located on the map in relation to where you are currently.

The Overall map of the area will utilize the maps from the visitor center and augment it with GPS information showing where you are currently within that map as a pinpoint marker.  It will enable touching on a point of interest to show a brief description of the location & that can be clicked again to navigate you to the detailed listing of points of interest.  It can toggle between showing all points of interest vs only the points of interest on your itinerary.

The Planned Itinerary will list out (by default) the points of interest from the visitor center's map (per their added order by default) and allow you to reorder add/remove items from the list.  If you click on these items, you can navigate to the detailed point of interest information to get more information.

Self-Assessment:
1) Completed successfully
2) Completed successfully
3) Completed successfully

Future items to consider:
1) Allow the annotation before drilling down to the detail view
2) Rotate the map per user's direction heading
3) Utilize / setup website pages for the information, as well as links to the websites for the points of interests
4) Utilize Core Data instead of plist for the datasets
5) Show path for itinerary on the map
6) Show path from current location to next location on itinerary on map and/or in text
